# Turing — Roadmap (active backlog)

> **Single source of truth for task status.** Flat, one line per task.
> Only **unshipped** work lives here (📋 designed · 💭 idea · ⏳ partial · 🛠 in-progress).
> Shipped work is moved to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); design rationale (the
> *what/why* per task) lives in [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md); strategy/positioning
> lives in [STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md).
>
> **How to pick work:** lowest-numbered task in a block whose `deps` are all shipped.
> The `→` pointer is the section in IMPROVEMENTS.md with the full design.

| 🛠 | In progress |

## Block W — Agent↔UI transparency & client tools (AG-UI parity)

> Closed the two AG-UI parity gaps for Turing's own agent runtime (live tool-call
> SSE + frontend-defined client tools). All 📋 tasks shipped — see
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) Block W. Only the optional protocol adapter remains.

- 💭 **T441** (deps: T436, T438) **Canonical AG-UI protocol adapter** — optional endpoint that re-encodes Turing's stream into the canonical AG-UI event schema (`RUN_STARTED`, `TEXT_MESSAGE_*`, `TOOL_CALL_*`, `STATE_SNAPSHOT`/`STATE_DELTA`, …) so CopilotKit's off-the-shelf React/Angular clients connect with zero Turing-SDK code. Distribution play, not core parity — promote from 💭 only if a named integration asks. → §XXII.6

## Block J follow-ups — Cloud SaaS hardening (T334–T373)

> Surfaced wiring Block J (multi-tenancy, shipped — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
> → Block J and [MULTI_TENANCY.md](MULTI_TENANCY.md)) into Viglet Cloud (one tenant
> per signed-up user on shared turing/solr/postgres infra). These are the gaps that
> remain for a *seamless* per-user SaaS; design in [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) §XIV.8.

- 📋 **T373** (deps: —) **Ship Cloud default config as a GLOBAL seed ZIP** — `TurExportImportOnStartup` already auto-imports `export/*.zip` once on first boot (guarded by the `EXPORT_AUTO_IMPORT` marker); guarantee the export emits/keeps `tenantId = null` for the 6 BYO-infra types so one seeded default LLM/SE/etc. is visible to every auto-provisioned tenant, and bake the seed ZIP into the Docker image. Closes the "default config for all users with zero post-deploy setup" ask for Viglet Cloud. Caveat: the same `TurSecretCryptoService` key must be set in every container or encrypted API keys won't decrypt. → §XIV.8.7

## Block O — GEO / LLM discoverability & content distribution

> Make LLM assistants (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Copilot) suggest Turing for
> "search for Adobe AEM / WordPress". Execution of [STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md)
> §IX.4; full memo + channel split + post calendar in §X. **Not engineering** —
> these are content/marketing/SEO tasks; some live in sibling repos
> (`openviglet.github.io`, `vigletdocs.github.io`). Sequence: foundation
> (T342) → off-domain signal (T346, T354 — strongest lever) → flagship content
> (T347, T350) → the rest. `→` pointers are STRATEGY §X.

**Content — integration how-tos (cluster A):**
- 💭 **T348** (deps: T347) **Post: "Semantic & vector search in AEM with Turing ES"** — RAG/embedding angle on the same audience. → §X.3
- 💭 **T349** (deps: T342) **Post: "Adding enterprise search to WordPress with Turing ES"** — the other named CMS; second-largest connector audience. → §X.3

**Content — comparison / "versus" (cluster B, rides competitor volume):**
- 💭 **T351** (deps: T350) **Post: "Turing ES vs. Coveo / vs. Lucidworks Fusion"** — head-to-head positioning for enterprise portals. → §X.3
- 💭 **T352** (deps: T350) **Post: "When to choose Solr, Elasticsearch, or Turing ES"** — captures the "which search engine" decision query. → §X.3

**Content — concept / moat (cluster C):**
- 💭 **T353** (deps: T342) **Post: "RAG over enterprise content with Turing + MCP"** — ties the §VIII.4 MCP pillar + Block M provenance into the discovery funnel. → §X.3

**Off-domain footprint (the strongest lever — X.1 #1):**
- 📋 **T354** (deps: —) **Seed independent mentions** — answer relevant SO/Reddit/AEM-forum threads; republish A/B posts to Dev.to/Medium (canonical → docs); list on AlternativeTo + `awesome-*` lists + G2. No code dep; pairs with T346. → §X.1
- 💭 **T355** (deps: T354) **Monthly model-prompt audit** — prompt ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini with the target queries, log whether Turing appears and where; the actual KPI for this block. → §X.4

## Block AB — Public site & top-of-funnel conversion (`turing.viglet.org`)

> The marketing site as a conversion surface, not a brochure. Positioning bet in
> [STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md) §XIV; build rationale in [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) §XXVII.
>
> **Phase 0 shipped (T473–T476)** — the `frontend/apps/site` app, analogy hero
> + pillars + comparison + sample-data live demo + quickstart + CLI section. See
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) → Block AB. Remaining (the defining bets):

- ⏳ **T477** (deps: T451–T457) **Public read-only demo instance behind the site** — ⏳ infra **shipped in `viglet/cloud`** (`docker compose --profile demo`: `turing-demo` + isolated `solr-demo`, anonymous/no-Keycloak, ephemeral tmpfs store wiped on reset, hardened, nginx deny-by-default allowlist + per-IP rate limits on `turing-demo.viglet.org`, periodic systemd reset; see `docker/DEMO.md`). **Seeding + LLM now automatic (T620):** `turing-demo` mounts `docker/demo-seed/` at `/app/export` so Turing auto-imports the seed ZIPs on boot, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` self-provisions the default LLM instance. **Seed sources committed:** `demo-seed-src/mythical-creatures` + `demo-seed-src/turing-docs` (T483). **Live as of 2026-07-10** — deployed at `https://turing-demo.viglet.org` (DNS + TLS resolved; `/api/sn/names` serves the seeded `mythical-creatures` + `turing-docs`). **Pending (host):** set the demo agent's budget cap. It backs the hero + marketplace demos (T478 ✅). → §XXVII.2
- 💭 **T480** (deps: T477) **Hosted "try it free" path via Viglet Cloud** — dual-path CTA (self-host docs + hosted sandbox) so visitors who won't install still reach first value. → §XXVII.3
- 💭 **T481** (deps: real design partners) **Social-proof surface** — adopters/logos, testimonials, quantified case studies (Dify model). Never fabricated. → §XXVII.3

## Block AT — Persona Match: N×N persona↔content fit projects (§XLIII)

> Reframes content-fit from the per-persona validation notebook (Block AA,
> `/bento/persona/validate/:id` — **1 persona × N contents**) into a reusable,
> scheduled **analysis project** holding **N contents × N personas** with a full
> fit matrix. Moves the surface up to `/bento/persona/`, beside Persona Dialogue.
> The motivating ask: create groups/projects of contents, pick many personas, and
> get a bidirectional report — *per content:* which persona each content best
> serves; *per persona:* which content each persona best serves — re-run on a
> schedule so personas and content stay tuned to each other. Reuses the Block AA
> evaluator (`TurPersonaContentFitEvaluator`, deterministic readability ⊕ grounded
> LLM judge) unchanged; the new work is the aggregate, the matrix, the scheduler,
> and the studio UI. Design in [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) §XLIII.

> **T696–T703 shipped** (see CHANGELOG Block AT) — domain model + project-scoped
> extraction + N×N runner (SSE) + CRUD/report API + scheduled re-analysis + the
> bento studio (list/workspace/heatmap/reports) + validate-route retirement. Only
> the trend/history bet remains:

- 💭 **T704** (deps: T698, T700) **Fit trend/history + adjustment suggestions** — persist per-cell score across scheduled runs; surface drift ("this content dropped below fit for persona X since last run") and LLM-suggested persona/content adjustments, closing the bidirectional tuning loop. → §XLIII

## Non-goals (do NOT add as tasks)

Binding constraints — see [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) §I.6 (What NOT to
refactor) and §I.7 (Restrictions) for the full text. Summary:

- Don't refactor the auto-trigger router, continuation logic, A/B assignment,
  sub-flow descent/ascent, SSE bus, defense-in-depth checks, silent telemetry,
  anti-injection / CPF-CNPJ / yes-no normalization, `TurToolCallbackPipeline.decorate`,
  or `summarizeVariables` cap — these are product, not patches.
- Structured output (LLM → JSON) is **not** a path — use provider-side tool-calling schemas.
- Don't rewrite the chat-flow DSL (`ChatFlowGraph` / `ChatFlowNode` shape) — only execution.
- Keep Spring AI `ChatModel.call()` + `internalToolExecutionEnabled(true)` (no framework swap).
- Heuristic and LlmJudge strategies coexist.
- No "auto-detect" middleware guessing node intent (toolFree, captureMode) — that's authorship.
- No in-process ONNX/DJL Whisper transcription runtime (the retired `LOCAL_ONNX` backend, ex-T694). The supported fully-local path is `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE` pointed at a self-hosted server (e.g. faster-whisper-server) — the platform won't bundle a fragile in-process Whisper dependency (T193 Jlama discipline).
